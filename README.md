# RLRM
A RL Replay Manager, it allows you to easily manage (import, export) replays for RL.


# Bug Reporting
You can submit an issue to this github, but it may not be seen.
The best way to report a bug is to add me on Discord (Zeval#7599) and DM me.

Please keep in mind that I will not help you if you have not already tried to fix the bug by running as an Admin and/or disabling anti-virus.

# Virus Concerns
If you're really all that worried about a virus in the program, run it in a VM or use Sandboxie to isolate the program.
Obviously, both of those things (especially sandboxie) can (and will probably) cause the program to not function correctly.

# Some things to note
- It has a 500 replay limit
- It may not work if you don't run it as admin
- It may get detected as a virus (it happened once to me while coding it)
- You can close the program with the Esc key

# Feature Suggestions
If you have a feature that you think the program would be better off having, please DM me on Discord (Zeval#7599).
