# RLRM
A RL Replay Manager, it allows you to easily manage (import, export) replays for RL.

# Bug Reporting
The best way to report a bug is through github's "issues" section. 
Please keep in mind that I will not help you if you have not already tried to fix the bug by running as an Admin and/or disabling anti-virus.

# Possible Limitation
- It's possible that there may be a limit (albeit a very high one) on the number of replays that can be properly listed in the application. There is no hardcoded limit, so the only limitation would be with C# and/or WPForms (the framework used for the GUI).
